This is a bare bones CLI RPG. 
I started this project to learn more about C++ Game Development, and the general basics of C++. (Yes I took inspiration from LOL for item names... sue me ;D )

FYI:
this is not an official Riot-affiliated project, it is free and all references belong to Riot Games.

Things that don't work at the moment:
 - Grievous Wounds debuff from the Thornmail item.
 - Balancing is sub-par...
